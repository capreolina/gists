&ldquo;genre(s)&rdquo; implicitly includes &ldquo;emo&rdquo; or whatever.

This list is intentionally designed to (mostly) avoid screamo. As a result, a
lot (most?) of this stuff ultimately stems from the &ldquo;midwest emo&rdquo;
strain of post-hardcore.

Entries are listed in roughly descending order of importance.

Slint and Indian Summer are just on here because they are responsible for
basically all emo music from the 1990s onward.

## Message sent to JoblessMS Discord

Hey y’all! ^^ I’m deer — perhaps not all of you have played JoblessMS with me before, but I played here a while back as a permadeath STR cleric named `deer`. Some of you may already be familiar with another pre-BB MapleStory server by the name of MapleLegends; me, and some of the other folks from this server, have played it before, and experimented with it especially when JoblessMS was having a lot of downtime in order to bring a new server source. Since then, I’ve essentially migrated to MapleLegends entirely. However, I’ve continued to play odd-jobbed characters — in fact, my dedication to them has only grown, thanks to JoblessMS revitalising my interest. That being said, one thing that I really missed from JoblessMS was an integrated community of people who were _also_ interested in playing the game in goofy-ass ways.

Wherever the MapleStory odd job community can thrive, I’d like to make that thriving a reality. And I was hoping that some of you might want to try MapleLegends on for size — it’s actually quite hospitable to all manner of odd jobs, and it’s quite fun!! Of course, no MapleStory server is perfect — MapleLegends, as a server, has its own share of problems, including the usual issues with HP washing and leeching. That being said, it has a solid and friendly playerbase, and has _lots_ of content, while still staying quite true to the O.G. pre-Big-Bang vibe! A while back, I created a guild on MapleLegends called **Oddjobs** with some other players from JoblessMS. Since then, Oddjobs has expanded to include many MapleLegends players, and is part of an alliance by the name of **Suboptimal**, which also includes guilds like **Southperry** (the main islander guild of MapleLegends), **Flow** (the main off-island permabeginner guild of MapleLegends), and even a guild called **Victoria** (a guild for Victoria-Island-locked characters).

Oddjobs has a dedicated website, which you can find at <https://oddjobs.codeberg.page/>. You can find some information about joining the guild within the “Join On Up” page, including the guild rules, and some information about how to contact me. Feel more than free to DM me about it here on Discord, and/or reach out to me in-game, and/or apply on the MapleLegends forums (<https://forum.maplelegends.com/index.php?threads/oddjobs.34994/>), and/or apply on the Oddjobs forums (<https://oddjobs.flarum.cloud/>)!

I asked for permission from `@GMSlut` to post this here — as it would otherwise be quite rude to advertise something from another server — because I genuinely want to revitalise the oddball MapleStory community. The guilds in Suboptimal have suffered from dwindling numbers & inactivity, and I want to help ameliorate the inactivity that is seen with odd-jobbers in MapleLegends and MapleStory in general. I hope to somehow reconnect the oddball MapleStory community with each other again, and I hope that y’all would consider taking a chance on MapleLegends, because I truly think it would be awesome to see oddball maplers thrive once again!! c: \<3

## Message sent to ML islander Discord

Hey y’all! I’m reaching out to as many MapleStory odd-jobbed & oddball communities as I possibly can, in the hopes of finding anyone interested in working with me to revitalise & rejuvenate the oddball MapleStory community, and create a unified place for folks to play MapleStory in unorthodox ways! ^^

In MapleLegends, I helped to found a guild by the name of **Oddjobs**. Oddjobs has since expanded to include a number of MapleLegends players, and has founded an alliance called **Suboptimal** specifically for oddball MapleStory, including guilds like **Flow** (the main off-island permabeginner guild of MapleLegends), **Victoria** (a guild for Victoria-Island-locked characters), and of course, **Southperry**! The oddball MapleStory community suffers from its sparsity, and Suboptimal is no exception — because I (and some others in Suboptimal) are so deeply invested in oddball MapleStory, we genuinely want to revitalise said community.

I was hoping that some of you might want to try MapleLegends on for size — it’s actually quite hospitable to _all_ manner of odd jobs (and generally oddball playstyles), and it’s quite fun!! Of course, no MapleStory server is perfect — MapleLegends, as a server, has its own share of problems, including the usual issues with HP washing and leeching. That being said, it has a solid and friendly playerbase, and has _lots_ of content, while still staying quite true to the O.G. pre-Big-Bang vibe!

Some of you probably already play (or have played) MapleLegends, and others may already be invested in other servers, e.g. MapleRoyals. It may be presumptuous to expect people to just uproot themselves and move to another server. That being said, I really do hope to somehow reconnect the oddball MapleStory community with each other again, and I hope that y’all would consider taking a chance on MapleLegends, because I truly think it would be awesome to see oddball maplers thrive once again!! c: \<3

If you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to DM me at `@deer#1028`!! Also, Oddjobs has a dedicated website that you can find at <https://oddjobs.codeberg.page/> — the “Join On Up” section has some info relevant to joining the guild, including rules, and some ways to contact me in-game.

### Discarded paragraphs

~~As I’m sure most of you know, the community for odd-jobbed (islanders, other permabeginners, other odd jobs) and generally oddball MapleStory is difficult to find, especially these days. With the oddball population of major servers dwindling and becoming less concentrated, it’s increasingly tough to find an integrated community of people who share a common interest of playing MapleStory in goofy-ass ways.~~

~~As I’ve observed the oddball MapleStory community, I can’t help but notice this dwindling of the population and lack of solid community. Suboptimal has suffered from this, and the guilds that make up Suboptimal have trouble keeping a stable population. I’ve personally been deeply invested in the oddball MapleStory community for a long time now, and both I, and many other oddball MapleLegends players, genuinely want to revitalise said oddball MapleStory community.~~

## ML Discord recruitment message(s)

(In Discord-flavoured Markdown)

- This is the style that I used to use, long ago when I recruited through `#recruitment` in the MapleLegends Discord server:

  ```markdown
  __**R\>Oddjobs**__ (<https://oddjobs.codeberg.page/>)

  • Odd jobbers only! See <https://oddjobs.codeberg.page/odd-jobs.html> for a (non-exhaustive) list of a few of them.
  • Very casual guild; anyone is welcome, as long as you’re an odd job!
  • Receiving leech is disallowed for members (& future members) of the guild.
  • Part of the **Suboptimal** alliance, alongside **Flow**, the _de facto_ off-island permabeginner guild of ML, & **Southperry**, the largest islander guild of ML!
  ```

- Maybe it’s better to take the angle of recruiting for Suboptimal:

  ```markdown
  __**R\>Suboptimal!**__

  Suboptimal is an alliance of four guilds (**Oddjobs** <https://oddjobs.codeberg.page/>, **Southperry**, **Flow**, & **Victoria**) seeking to promote oddball MapleStory!

  We are looking particularly for those dedicated to playing odd-jobbed characters like permabeginners, islanders, STR mages, & HP warriors (see <https://oddjobs.codeberg.page/odd-jobs.html> for a non-exhaustive list of a few odd jobs). Southperry is dedicated to islanders & campers, Flow is dedicated mostly to off-island permabeginners, and Oddjobs is dedicated to any type of odd job! We also have Victoria, which is dedicated to Victoria-Island-locked (but not necessarily odd) characters :)

  The oddball MapleStory community suffers from its sparsity, and Suboptimal is no exception — because I (and some others in Suboptimal) are so deeply invested in oddball MapleStory, we genuinely want to revitalise said community. So, we humbly ask anyone interested to give some real consideration to joining us, and helping to form a fun community together that preserves oddball MapleStory!! \<3
  ```

- Or maybe something in between! (This is currently what I’m using):

  ```markdown
  __**R\>Oddjobs**__ (<https://oddjobs.codeberg.page/>)

  • Odd jobbers only! See <https://oddjobs.codeberg.page/odd-jobs.html> for a (non-exhaustive) list of a few of them.
  • Very casual guild; anyone is welcome, as long as you’re an odd job!
  • Receiving leech is disallowed for members (& future members) of the guild.
  • Part of the **Suboptimal** alliance, alongside **Flow**, the _de facto_ off-island permabeginner guild of ML, & **Southperry**, the largest islander guild of ML!

  The oddball MapleStory community suffers from its sparsity, and Suboptimal is no exception — because I (and some others in Suboptimal) are so deeply invested in oddball MapleStory, we genuinely want to revitalise said community. So, we humbly ask anyone interested to give some real consideration to joining us, and helping to form a fun community together that preserves oddball MapleStory!! \<3

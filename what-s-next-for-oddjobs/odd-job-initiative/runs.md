# Oddjobs/Suboptimal runs & activities!

Just spitballing here! Although it seems like an obvious thing to do, I’m not
100% convinced that we have to associate a particular activity (e\.g.
“Ravana/Papulatus”) with each time. An alternative approach is to merely set
times, and then depending on who “shows up” (on Discord and/or in-game), those
in attendance can decide what to do.

All times are in
[UTC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time) (a\.k\.a.
[GMT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenwich_Mean_Time), a\.k\.a. server time,
a\.k\.a. ST).

## Who runs?

There’s always the (quite likely) possibility that we have an issue with
attendance. In general, we expect that an attendance issue is a result of
having too _few_ people. Of course, the opposite (having too _many_ people) is
possible, as well. So, how do we fix either of these issues?

With two _few_ people, our options are basically:

- Recruit more people to fill in the gaps.
- Do something else that we _do_ have enough people for.
- Give up.

With too _many_ people, our options are basically:

- Split up into more parties than are currently formed.
- Some people just don’t participate.

We have a similar issue in both cases: in the former case, with “recruit\[ing\]
more people to fill in the gaps”; in the latter case, with “some people just
don’t participate”. Both of these options ask the question of: _who_ should be
(un-)recruited? To help answer this question, we can make a kind of “priority
list” — those who are closer to the top of the list have higher priority (more
likely to be recruited, less likely to be un-recruited) than those further
down:

1. Odd-jobbed characters who are members of **Suboptimal**.
2. Odd-jobbed characters who are not members of Suboptimal.
3. Non-odd characters who are members of Suboptimal.
4. Non-odd characters who are not members of Suboptimal.

Notice that we’re including non-odd characters in this priority list, although
they always have strictly lower priority than any odd-jobbed character. The
reasoning here is that I want to _allow_ mixed runs (“mixed” meaning some odd
characters, some non-odd), but obviously prioritise fully-odd runs. Mixed runs
may be necessary when we lack enough people to do a run, especially if that run
has demanding requirements!

The one exception here is SPQ, which is so guild-based that I want all SPQ runs
to be Oddjobs-only. That being said, it’s okay with me if odd-jobbers from
other guilds join Oddjobs temporarily for the purpose of SPQing. Just so long
as they aren’t non-odd characters.

**Red** (leader of the **GangGang** guild, but also has some characters in
Suboptimal) suggested doing some kind of joint Suboptimal-**Dream** (Dream is
the alliance that GangGang is in with **Chroma**) runs of tough-ish things like
Ravana and Papulatus. This would give some odd characters the chance to
participate in these kinds of runs and see what it’s all about. Also, if you
have a non-odd character that can attend a run, even though none of your odd
ones can, you can still help fill attendence gaps, if such gaps arise.

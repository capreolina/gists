# Oddjobs/Suboptimal runs & activities!

Just spitballing here! Although it seems like an obvious thing to do, I’m not
100% convinced that we have to associate a particular activity (e\.g.
“Ravana/Papulatus”) with each time. An alternative approach is to merely set
times, and then depending on who “shows up” (on Discord and/or in-game), those
in attendance can decide what to do.

All times are in
[UTC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time) (a\.k\.a.
[GMT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenwich_Mean_Time), a\.k\.a. server time,
a\.k\.a. ST).

## Can I join?

If you’re afraid that your odd-jobbed character is unable to participate in
some of the activities above, consider the actual requirements:

- SPQ/APQ: **For SPQ, no requirements. For APQ, level ≥40 and married.**
- Low-level & area bosses: **No requirements.** Area bosses range all
  the way from _Mano_ to Kacchuu Musha, and everything in between. There’s
  almost certainly at least one area boss (including Capt. Latanica as a
  “low-level” boss) in the game that is appropriate for your character to have
  a challenging fight against. That being said, we tend to hover around the
  HH/Capt. Lat level, but don’t let that discourage you from suggesting a
  lower-level run.
- Assorted PQs: **Must be level ≤100.** PQs start around level 10 (with HPQ),
  and go as high as level 100 with PPQ/MLGPQ. Technically, HPQ allows any level
  ≥10 character to participate, but usually, taking an overleveled character is
  just too much for our purposes.
- Ravana/Papulatus: **At least 3\.3k–3\.4k MAXHP clean, to survive with HB. For
  Papulatus specifically, prequests are required (level ≥80 for prequests).**

## Who runs?

There’s always the (quite likely) possibility that we have an issue with
attendance. In general, we expect that an attendance issue is a result of
having too _few_ people. Of course, the opposite (having too _many_ people) is
possible, as well. So, how do we fix either of these issues?

With two _few_ people, our options are basically:

- Recruit more people to fill in the gaps.
- Do something else that we _do_ have enough people for.
- Give up.

With too _many_ people, our options are basically:

- Split up into more parties than are currently formed.
- Some people just don’t participate.

We have a similar issue in both cases: in the former case, with “recruit\[ing\]
more people to fill in the gaps”; in the latter case, with “some people just
don’t participate”. Both of these options ask the question of: _who_ should be
(un-)recruited? To help answer this question, we can make a kind of “priority
list” — those who are closer to the top of the list have higher priority (more
likely to be recruited, less likely to be un-recruited) than those further
down:

1. Odd-jobbed characters who are members of **Suboptimal**.
2. Odd-jobbed characters who are not members of Suboptimal.
3. Non-odd characters who are members of Suboptimal.
4. Non-odd characters who are not members of Suboptimal.

Notice that we’re including non-odd characters in this priority list, although
they always have strictly lower priority than any odd-jobbed character. The
reasoning here is that I want to _allow_ mixed runs (“mixed” meaning some odd
characters, some non-odd), but obviously prioritise fully-odd runs. Mixed runs
may be necessary when we lack enough people to do a run, especially if that run
has demanding requirements!

The one exception here is SPQ, which is so guild-based that I want all SPQ runs
to be Oddjobs-only. That being said, it’s okay with me if odd-jobbers from
other guilds join Oddjobs temporarily for the purpose of SPQing. Just so long
as they aren’t non-odd characters.

**Red** (leader of the **GangGang** guild, but also has some characters in
Suboptimal) suggested doing some kind of joint Suboptimal-**Dream** (Dream is
the alliance that GangGang is in with **Chroma**) runs of tough-ish things like
Ravana and Papulatus. This would give some odd characters the chance to
participate in these kinds of runs and see what it’s all about. Also, if you
have a non-odd character that can attend a run, even though none of your odd
ones can, you can still help fill attendence gaps, if such gaps arise.

# Oddjobs/Suboptimal runs & activities!

Just spitballing here! Although it seems like an obvious thing to do, I’m not
100% convinced that we have to associate a particular activity (e.g.
“Ravana/Papulatus”) with each time. An alternative approach is to merely set
times, and then depending on who “shows up” (on Discord and/or in-game), those
in attendance can decide what to do.

# Oddjobs/Suboptimal runs & activities!

Just spitballing here! Although it seems like an obvious thing to do, I’m not
100% convinced that we have to associate a particular activity (e.g.
“Ravana/Papulatus”) with each time. An alternative approach is to merely set
times, and then depending on who “shows up” (on Discord and/or in-game), those
in attendance can decide what to do.

All times are in
[UTC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time) (a\.k\.a.
[GMT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenwich_Mean_Time), a\.k\.a. server time,
a\.k\.a. ST).

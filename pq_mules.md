# deer&rsquo;s party-questing services~

Okay, so maybe &ldquo;services&rdquo; is a bit of a stretch, but I do have
three PQ mules who are of an appropriate level to do their respective PQs, and
are thus fully functional! I hope to help out struggling PQers who are having
trouble forming a functional party, and in the process, give some support and
life to these party quests.

Here are some things to keep in mind:

- I offer these &ldquo;services&rdquo; completely free of charge. I will never
  require payment of any kind, although I will accept smol donations of
  whatever, if you&rsquo;re feeling generous :P
- I will, obviously, not be available 24/7 to PQ with you. I may be offline, or
  in-game but busy doing something else, or I may just not feel like PQing! But
  you can always give it a shot.
- Speaking of giving it a shot, feel free to ping me (or even DM me, although I
  should reiterate that there&rsquo;s no guarantee that I will reply) on
  Discord; my handle is `deer#1028`. Pinging me might look something like:

  ![R>1 mage for MPQ @deer](ping-me.png "R>1 mage for MPQ @deer")

  You can also try to get a hold of me in-game, although I go by quite a few
  IGNs\*, so this may prove difficult. A
  [smega](https://maplelegends.com/lib/cash?id=5072000) may or may not do the
  trick.
- I share equipment very heavily between my characters, so it may take me a bit
  of time to set up a given PQ mule with appropriate gear.
- If you don&rsquo;t have very much experience with the PQ in question,
  don&rsquo;t sweat it. Just let me know if you&rsquo;re new, or perhaps have a
  shaky grasp of (a) certain stage(s), and I&rsquo;m more than happy to help
  you learn it.

## MPQ (Magatia)

IGN: `potpan`.

Build: pure INT F/P mage.

potpan can:

- Provide the brute force necessary to complete the combat-oriented portions of
  MPQ, up to and including soloing [Angry
  Franky](https://maplelegends.com/lib/monster?id=9300140).
- Complete the &ldquo;mage portal&rdquo; of [stage
  4](https://maplelegends.com/lib/map?id=926100200).
- Complete the &ldquo;thief portal&rdquo; of stage 4.

potpan cannot:

- Very effectively protect Romeo/Juliet in the final stage of MPQ. potpan _can_
  be somewhat effective at this via [simple brute
  force](https://maplelegends.com/lib/skill?id=2101004), but lacks more precise
  mob control like e.g. [Blank
  Shot](https://maplelegends.com/lib/skill?id=5201004). In any case, it&rsquo;s
  probably better if potpan directs all of her efforts towards slaying Franken
  Lloyd.

potpan&rsquo;s to-do list:

- Get to level 85.
- Get a [Ravana Helmet](https://maplelegends.com/lib/equip?id=01003068).
- Get the [tier 1 Monster Book
  Ring](https://maplelegends.com/lib/equip?id=01119003).

## OPQ (Orbis)

IGN: `sets`.

Build: pure LUK hermit.

sets can:

- Provide the party with
  [Haste](https://maplelegends.com/lib/skill?id=4101004).
- Complete any of the JQs in [the Lobby
  stage](https://maplelegends.com/lib/map?id=920010400) that don&rsquo;t
  require [Teleport](https://maplelegends.com/lib/skill?id=2101002).
- Lead [the Sealed Room stage](https://maplelegends.com/lib/map?id=920010500).
- Complete any of the rooms in [the Lounge
  stage](https://maplelegends.com/lib/map?id=920010600).
- Provide the brute force necessary to complete the combat-oriented portions of
  OPQ, up to and including soloing [Papa
  Pixie](https://maplelegends.com/lib/monster?id=9300039).

sets cannot:

- Use [Teleport](https://maplelegends.com/lib/skill?id=2101002) to complete the
  JQs in [the Lobby stage](https://maplelegends.com/lib/map?id=920010400) that
  require this skill.

sets&rsquo;s to-do list:

- Get to level 70 and job advance.
- Get a [Skanda](https://maplelegends.com/lib/equip?id=01472055).
- Get a helmet (probably a
  [zhelm](https://maplelegends.com/lib/equip?id=01002357), but a [Ravana
  Helmet](https://maplelegends.com/lib/equip?id=01003068) would be even nicer).
- Get the [tier 1 Monster Book
  Ring](https://maplelegends.com/lib/equip?id=01119003).

## LPQ (Ludibrium)

IGN: `sorts`.

Build: [pure DEX
brawler](https://oddjobs.codeberg.page/odd-jobs.html#dex-brawler).

sorts can:

- Contribute the truly ranged DPS necessary for [stage
  7](https://maplelegends.com/lib/map?id=922010700). Yes, really.
- Complete [the &ldquo;thief
  portal&rdquo;](https://maplelegends.com/lib/map?id=922010506) of [stage
  5](https://maplelegends.com/lib/map?id=922010500).
- Lead the &ldquo;JMS&rdquo; method of completing [stage
  8](https://maplelegends.com/lib/map?id=922010800), starting on any box
  (although I prefer to start on 4).
- Complete any of the portals, &ldquo;physical&rdquo; or
  &ldquo;magical&rdquo;\*, of [stage
  4](https://maplelegends.com/lib/map?id=922010400).
- Provide the brute force necessary to complete the combat-oriented portions of
  LPQ, up to and including soloing
  [Alishar](https://maplelegends.com/lib/monster?id=9300012).

\*At the time of writing, sorts needs some more levels and gear to very
effectively do magical-attacker portals.

sorts cannot:

- Complete [the &ldquo;mage&rdquo;
  portal](https://maplelegends.com/lib/map?id=922010501) of [stage

  Ring](https://maplelegends.com/lib/equip?id=01119003).

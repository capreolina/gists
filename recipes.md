These are all vegan, obviously.

## Creamy pasta (a\.k\.a. cheezy pasta)

### Ingredients

- 400&#x301c;500 g pasta, uncooked.
- 25 g flour (I use bleached and re-enriched wheat flour; however, other kinds
  of flour would probably work here).
- 25 g vegan butter (if you haven’t butter, you can substitute a similar amount
  of an oil blend, e\.g. olive oil &amp; canola oil, or even just a single
  oil).
- 350&#x301c;400 mL unsweetened vegan milk (I use almond milk, but it probably
  doesn’t matter all that much).

#### Other stuff

You can kinda mix &amp; match here. Feel free to experiment, this roux is quite
flexible.

- Salt, to taste.
- Dried &amp; crushed oregano leaves, to taste (I really like putting in
  oregano, the flavour is great and the specks add visual texture :P).
- ½&#x301c;1 lemon’s (or lime’s) worth of lemon (or lime) juice (this recipe
  needs a source of acidity, and lemon juice is a good way to do it!).
- Finely minced garlic and/or garlic powder, to taste.
- Onion powder, to taste.
- 5&#x301c;20 g nooch (good flavour, good protein, good vitamins, and some iron
  to boot).
- Hot sauce, to taste (spices it up, adds much-needed acidity, good flavour if
  you use good sauce, and red sauces will make the result a pleasing orangish
  colour).
- Soya sauce and/or tamari, to taste (good source of salt if you put little or
  no salt in, darkens the colour a bit, and gives some sharpness to the
  flavour).
- Vegan cheese (this recipe can be used to thicken out some cheese that you
  wanted to use for pasta anyways).

### Instructions

1. Start cooking the pasta as you usually would.
2. Put the butter in a separate smaller pot on medium heat, until fully or
   almost fully melted.
3. Scoop the flour into the melted butter, and stir it around so that it sops
   up the butter. If you get a little bit of boiling, that’s okay, but try not
   to violently boil it or sear anything.
4. Now that you have a clumped-up flour–butter mixture, pour in the almond
   milk. Stir this stuff together while somewhere between medium and high heat.
5. At first, the flour–butter complex (the roux) will remain concerningly
   clumpy, but with enough stirring and heat, it will naturally disperse and
   dissolve into the milk. The milk should come to a boil (but not a rapid
   boil!) and start to increase in viscosity.
    - **NOTE:** If the mixture is too dry and/or thickens too rapidly, you can
      add in more milk (or even just some water). If the mixture doesn’t
      thicken quickly enough, you can try to wait it out (waiting for more
      water to boil off), or add flour/starch. If you add extra flour or
      (corn/arrowroot) starch, I recommend mixing it with some water (or
      something watery that you were going to add anyways, e\.g. lemon juice)
      in a separate small bowl/cup before putting it into the mixture. Mixing
      it thoroughly (i\.e. until completely liquid with no lumps) into water
      will help the end result be less lumpy and clumpy.
6. Once the roux is dissolved and the mixture has started to thicken, you can
   start adding in all of the “other stuff”. With some stirring, the result
   will become homogeneous.
7. Pour the mixture into the cooked pasta and stir until fully coated.

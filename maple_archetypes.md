## Dark knight

“Hell hath no fury like the mother of dragons”

Though they may be defined by their combination of mysticism with unbridled
fury, the dark knight always fights honourably. The fury of the dark knight is
that of a mother dragon protecting her children from harm; the dark knight is
one of the most powerful defensive allies that a party can have.

Although the dark knight may be defensively superb for their allies — and
excellent at dispatching multiple enemies at once — this comes at a cost: the
dark knight constantly exists in a precarious position between life and death.
The dark knight’s raw might originates from mystic blood sacrifices that they
make, which ironically makes them more fragile than their fellow warriors.
